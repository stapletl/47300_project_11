The run_all program can be used to evaluation several versions of the algorithm against all the levels in a levels file. 

You won't need this program if you just want to run only your competition algorithm.

You can control what algorithms are run by modifying the run_all.py file, changing the to_compare list.

The results from run_all.py using our solver on ecegrid, on the levels provided, are shown in a subdirectory results-for-our-solver here.

We just include this program so you can see what generated the result that are included.
